How about this, maybe..  skill.. or level.  So, like a
level 1 sword user would do randomly between 1 and 100
damage.. or, range skill.level to 100

so, dumb luck!  you are possible!  Heroes always roll
perfect though.


OK, this is actually brilliant - go to player room, then 
password room then character room!

or.. paswords out of character rooms, so other people can
check you out!  maybe, we dump gear in the password room, so
people can pass it if they really want to.
