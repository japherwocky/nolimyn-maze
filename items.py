"""
So everyone gets a Weapon a Shield and an Armor .. or whatever..
lots of pieces actually 
you can customize your own shit, but only your own; but if you
manage to take someone elses you can piggyback

when someone dies, let their stuff be stolen by imps, who take one
piece but spawn the rest in chests around the level. so killer has
a chance to go run around and get their gear just to be an ass.
