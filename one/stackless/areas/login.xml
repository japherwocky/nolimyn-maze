Ooph.  Didn't make it very far, did we?  OK, so typing
'login' will take you to the login room.  You typed 'help'
which got you here.  Typing 'look' or 'l' will show you this.

Typing anything in the brackets below will take you to that room.

There is a sign here, bearing only the word, "FOO".

Behind the scenes, this room is an example on how to
code functions which exist only in one room.

This is your PLAYER account: it represents
you as a person.  You may roll as many
CHARACTERS as you'd like, but having multiple
player accounts is lame as hell.
