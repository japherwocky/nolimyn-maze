SLICE
Syntax: slice

This technique attempts to open a broad wound, using the mass and reach of
a polearm.  If the attack has enough power and accuracy behind it, it will 
leave a wound that stays bleeding for a short time.

An Unholy Place
  After groping and coughing your way through what seems like miles
of gray smoke, you arrive in this structure.  An almost tangible
feeling of unease overwhelms you as you realize that this shrine
has been constructed from still-living humans, saurians, and other
sentient creatures, all of which appear to be in great pain, in a 
grotesque parody of the K'sra shrine to life.  Several brass 
braziers set around the room explain the origin of the gray smoke, 
leaving you to wonder only why the walls do not scream.

In the Village of the Sz'weh
  The path leads on towards huts to the east, south, and west.  A 
path also leads north; however, you are unable to see what lies
in that direction due to the thick smoke.  Indeed, it seems as
though the smoke is originating from the north.  Perhaps it would
be safer to proceed instead in a different direction.

  The path leads on to huts in all directions as far as the eye can
see, which isn't terribly far due to the presence of the gray
smoke.  The village seems unusually orderly in layout; its neat
paths have more in common with Tir-Talath or Voralian City than the village
of the K'sra.  Black eyes stare balefully from the bone and hide huts,
filling you with unease.

An Entrance to the Village of the Sz'weh
  The swamp comes to an abrupt and enigmatic end here.  The foliage is
much more sparse here, and you are at a loss to explain what keeps it
at bay.  The ubiquitous green mist is largely replaced by a foul-
smelling gray smoke; you're not sure it's an improvement.  A path
made of a white gravel-like substance leads north into the village.  
Crude huts, which look to be constructed from bone and animal hides, 
can be seen to both sides of the path.

obvious that no one passes this way very often.  The faint, briny scent

  A high arching bridge spans the width of a narrow but deep valley here, 
carrying the forest road on its journey to the north and south.  Low walls

but not high enough to prevent you from falling should you approach too 
close.  A stiff breeze constantly blows from the west to the east, howling 
faintly as it bounces off the valley walls below.  From the raised center of 
the span the contours of the Feanwyyn Weald are easily seen; the steep hills 
and ridges surrounding the deep valley to the east and west, the gently 
sloping plain of the river to the south, and the flat plateau of the forest

The Forest Trail
  Travel is slow in the dark forest, the trail is broken by the surfaced
roots of the great trees, and the constant encroachment of vines and
creepers. The trees press close to the trail, and low branches must be
moved aside in many instances. The woods are quiet in this darkened place -
no normal bird nor animal makes its presence known.

Passing Through a Tree
  The trail passes through the base of a large tree in which a tunnel has
been carved. The trail could have been constructed around the tree, but the
builders so long ago, decided otherwise. As the giant tree has grown over
the years, the tunnel within its base has decreased in size. Travel is slow
as care must be exercised to keep pitch from the tree away from the
traveler.

great hemlock, oak and yew obscure the sky. The eerie screeching of owls

Passing Through a Tree
  The trail passes through the base of a large tree in which a tunnel has
been carved. The trail could have been constructed around the tree, but the
builders so long ago, decided otherwise. As the giant tree has grown over
the years, the tunnel within its base has decreased in size. Travel is slow
as care must be exercised to keep pitch from the tree away from the
traveler.

About nine feet tall, this Ugruk's yellow skin is of a somewhat lighter tone 
than her male companions.  Though her face has yet to show any prominent
signs of aging, she is still quite ugly by human standards.  Her dress is 
very crude, made from leather hides of animals.  Unlike the others, she also
wears a number of adornments, including jewelry, ranging from animal bones in 
her hair to a few pieces of human jewelry, perhaps an indication of favor or
status among the tribe.  This doesn't seem to exempt her from work, however,
as she seems to be busily chopping up several dirty tubers, most likely to be

About nine feet tall, this Ugruk's yellow skin is of a somewhat lighter tone 
than her male companions.  Though her face has yet to show any prominent
signs of aging, she is still quite ugly by human standards.  Her dress is 
very crude, made from leather hides of animals, probably of the same species 
that she is busily skinning now.

A black tip winged arial stands before you.  He is 
wearing thin black robes that are adorned with 
religious glyphs.  He has a slender jet-black beak
that curves downward, much like that of a bird of
prey.  He has bright green eyes that shine brightly
from the confines of a shadowed hood.  He stands
confidently and is gripping a thin sword with his
clawed fingers.

Passing Through a Tree
  The trail passes through the base of a large tree in which a tunnel has
been carved. The trail could have been constructed around the tree, but the
builders so long ago, decided otherwise. As the giant tree has grown over

as care must be exercised to keep pitch from the tree away from the

pegs are set near the door, holding a variety of cloaks and hats, but there
is also a wooden rack used to dry damp clothing. Like the rest of the
feasthall, this area is a continuation of logs, beams, an earthen floor, and
living trees. Many of the rafters overhead originate from the presence of
the large oaks that add support to the feasthall. Light is provided by
crystal and brass lanterns hanging from the overhead branches and rafters,
and the occasional firepits that are used for warmth and cooking. Crude
wooden trestle tables and long benches provide places for patrons to enjoy
the foods and drinks provided for a modest fee. The sounds of music, laughter,

  Like the rest of the feasthall, this area is a continuation of logs, beams,
an earthen floor, and living trees. Many of the rafters overhead originate
from the presence of the large oaks that add support to the feasthall.
Light is provided by crystal and brass lanterns hanging from the overhead
branches and rafters, and the occasional firepits that are used for warmth
and cooking. Crude wooden trestle tables and long benches provide places for
patrons to enjoy the foods and drinks provided for a modest fee. The sounds
of music, laughter, shouting and talking carry throughout the feasthall,
woven in an intricate dance with the smells of cooking foods and spiced

Entryway to the Feasthall
  A large set of ornate wooden doors are set into the east wall, allowing
escape into the quieter woods beyond. All other directions, the feasthall
expands and brings with it, a cacophony of sounds, sights and odors. Wooden
pegs are set near the door, holding a variety of cloaks and hats, but there
is also a wooden rack used to dry damp clothing. Like the rest of the

Before the Feasthall
  The trees have been cleared in this area, to make room for an immense log
structure. Dark logs and standing trees have been woven together to form a
great feasting hall. A pair of large, ornate wooden doors are centered in
the eastern wall of the building, and they in turn are flanked by great
multi-paned windows of stained glass. The roof of the structure is a
combination of living tree branches and split logs, with some of the roof
intentionally left open. Woodsmoke and the smell of cooking foods issues
from the roof openings, and sounds of music and laughter resound though the
area. Empty lamphooks flank the entry doors, while situated above the
doorway is a life-sized painting of a smiling peasant girl.

Along a Heavily Wooded Hillside
  The wooded hillside, while still rife with trees, slowly begins its
transformation from a deciduous to coniferous forest. As the slope climbs,
the oaks give way to more pine, hemlock and alder, while in the darker
ravines, and downslope, the broadleaf trees still reign. The forest has
thinned somewhat, and the ground cover has thickened with more blackberry
vines and patches of heath. The air is fresh and fragrant with the brose of
small pine trees that grow in clumps and stands dotted over the landscape.
The faint smell of woodsmoke is in the air. A narrow trail descends, while

The Hanging Tree
  The large clearing is ringed by old oaks grown dark and leaf-bound over the
years. The clearing frames a large oak tree in its center whose branches
span much of the clearing. From its lowest branches, though still twenty
feet off the ground, the remnants of old ropes are still attached to the
tree, though the bodies that once hung there, have long-since been removed.
Ravens now adorn the branches of the ancient tree, their presence announced
by with raucous cries that echo through the wood. At the base of the tree,
the area is devoid of normal vegetation, and black vines and creepers
encircle its trunk, climbing slowly up its surface. The hanging tree sits
at what once was an intersection of trails, long-since lost to time. An
opening among the thick ring of trees surrounding the glade lies to the
south and there is a path to the east.

the trees, joining with the sounds of winds and wildlife. The trees grow

Among the Encampment
  The clearing holds several small lean-tos scattered among the trees, each
providing a small shelter from the elements.  The faint smell of smoke and
cooking foods drifts among the clearing, and the sounds of voices  echoes
among the trees.  The encampment forms a gathering place for the Wolfheads
who care little for the ways of civilization.  Here, they live simple lives
outside the boundaries of society and culture, shunning the plague of such
mentality.  Those who live here have discarded the use of coinage and
similar luxuries common to cities, preferring a more rustic lifestyle.

  The hill slopes somewhat steeply and travels among heavy woods, though with
less oaks and more hemlock and alder.  As the forest has thinned somewhat,
the ground cover has thickened with more blackberry vines and patches of

  This is a simple one-room house.  The walls are built out of wood and are
painted a pale blue.  On the south wall hangs a huge hammock covered with
pillows and blankets.  The east wall has a large table with a cabinet hanging
over it on the wall.  Two chairs sit opposite each other at the table.  The
west wall has a few shelves on it and a wardrobe sits in the corner.  A
large lamp hangs from the high beamed ceiling to provide illumination and
there are windows with white curtains in all four walls that are open to
provide access to the breeze.

floor polished to a lustrous gleam.  Tables and chairs carved from white ash
are spread through the room, though the focus is placed firmly upon the solid
marble bar against the southern wall.  The entire ceiling appears to have

slow, sleepy mood of the Cove of the Adrift.  He is plainly dressed in a vest
of seaweed and small shells, while his pants are of a fine linen.  A single

the Cove of the Adrift watches his guests with an aloof attitude.  Though he 
sees to the needs of his guests, he gives the impression that he is doing them
a favor.  His dark hair, of medium length, has been combed back neatly, each
hair carefully held in place.  His face seems to hint towards noble blood in
his veins, but his presence here questions that possibility.  He seems ill-
at-ease in his clothing, a simple coat and pants of fine silk, and shifts

  Only four large beds occupy this large space, gauzy curtains between each 
offers an amount of privacy to those able to afford these accommodations.  The 
beds are large and soft, complete with silken sheets, thick wool blankets, and 
light, feather-filled pillows.  The hazy, indistinct light seems to have no 
discernable source as it flows through the gauzy curtains.  Instead, it simply 
diffuses out into the room, rendering candles and lanterns unnecessary in
these quiet quarters.  The walls and floor are polished to the high sheen
found in the common room, while the ceiling has been hidden by a draped sheet

Embrace of the Sea
  Despite a number of skylights allowing a veritable cascade of sunlight
into this small shop, a musty odor remains in the air.  A large planter sits
beneath every skylight, raised up to a manageable level for a storm giant by
a large stand.  Each planter contains a different terrestrial herb or bush,
many in full bloom. Large wooden vats line the walls, plaques label each with
the name of a different plant harvested from the depths of Loch Terradian. On
the wall is a sign giving the hours the shop is open.

His back still twisted and bent by his enormous pack, this thin man leans
wearily against a tree, his pack now gone from his shoulders and resting by
his side.  Every part of his body droops with exhaustion, even his thick gray 
mustache seems to be tired.  His hair, equally gray, is unkempt and tangled, 
he has likely been running his hands through it recently.  Light stubble
covers his cheeks and chin, leaving the bottom half of his face shadowy and
dark.

The Crashing Surf
  Large waves crest and break in here in the rapidly receding water.  The 
sound of the crashing waves is inescapable as they smash into the sandy shore, 
each struggling to reach further on the shore than the previous.  A strong
wind blows over the tops of the waves, causing a sharp, stinging mist to tear
free of the waves and sting any exposed flesh it finds.  The air is filled
with the smell of the sea and drifting mist.  The water itself is murky, dark
with disturbed sand and shells, swirling beneath the surface in a chaotic
dance.  Deeper parts of the lake lie to the west, with calmer water, while the
shore is to the east.

Still dressed in the colors of the Seantryn Modan navy, this sailor seems to
be using years of shore leave to visit Loch Terradian. His hair is graying at
the temples, and he has a certain dignified look to him. Right now, however,
he seems content spending his time away from his ship and drinking in a seedy 
waterside bar, a sea and a continent away from his home port. A tall glass 
stands before him, though he seems unaffected by the large amount of alcohol
he has already consumed.

House of a Hundred Winds
  A large bar dominates the southern wall of the House of a Hundred Winds.  The
dim light bounces from the countless bottles stored behind the bar, creating 
dancing sparkles of varicolored light throughout the murky building.  The
walls and floor have been left largely bare, anything upon them is more scorch
or stain than intended decoration.  A narrow staircase leads upwards to the
roof, while a battered piano has been shoved against the western wall.  Aside
from the numerous emptied bottles, the bar contains a broken clay jar, filled
to the broken edges with chunks of bread. A sign over the bar gives the hours
the bar is open.

The Base of a Tower
  Supplies line the walls of this small room, barrels marked with the seal of 
Mortorn and leather wrapped bundles with the royal crest of Darsylon lay on the
floor and shelves, carefully organized by some unknown schema. The walls are of
the same rough white substance as the battlements, still jagged with the sharp
edges of the tiny shells. A pair of torches offer meager light, though it is
far from dark as light streams in from the ceiling and door. A large ladder,
easily able to support the weight of a storm giant, rises up from the floor to
the ceiling, where it passes through a hole cut into the ceiling.

guard towers, the sheer cliffs surrounding the lake visible beyond the towers.
A high battlement rises from the wall to the east and a series of platforms and
ladders allows for a non-giant to peer over the edge, or join in any defensive 
action needed.  Unlit torches line the battlements, ready to be lit come 
nightfall.  The countless shells that make up the wall have been worn smooth
on the path of the patrolling giants, while the edges of the battlements

Although far from slender, this storm giant guard lacks the musculature of his 
fellow guardsmen.  His wiry arms hold an enormous arbalest over his shoulder, 
the crank turned and a large bolt already in place.  His long green hair has 
been pulled into a loose braid, though the gusty winds on the wall have
already ruined any semblance of order it might have once had.  His sparkling
blue eyes watch over the surface of Loch Terradian, as he slowly turns and
scans the entirety of the waters before the battlements.

An enormous storm giant, Rusal stands a head above the tallest of the guards.
Unlike so many of the other storm giants on the platform, his hair is a wild
mane, tangled and disheveled by the howling wind.  His eyes have a slightly
wild set to them as he looks longingly at the waters of Loch Terradian.  He
forgoes the ceremonial armor worn by the guards, instead wearing ancient armor
made of sharkskin and kraken hide.  Scars cover his muscular arms, ranging
from the clean and precise to the jagged and rough.  Oddly, his feet are bare,
despite the often rough surface of the platform.

Weathered by time, this ancient storm giant is dressed only in a simple seaweed
kilt.  His pale green hair, lightened by the long years of his life, is braided
into a long rope reaching to his waist.  His beard is gathered together by a
simple band as it reaches down to his stomach.  Lacking the bulging muscles so
common amongst storm giant warriors, he leaner and more wiry, a mixture of
speed and strength which has likely left a number of younger warriors soundly
defeated.  Currently he moves gracefully through a number of stances as he
flows through the concentric rings drawn into the floor of the sandy arena,
his movements more befitting a dancer than a warrior.

  The rough white walls of the Trade Winds are bare, save for a row of large

just below the level of the shelves.  Further above the beam a number of ledges
and alcoves run along the walls.  Oddly, the northern half of the ceiling has
been removed, leaving the Trade Winds open to the sky.  The stone of the floor,
worm smooth on the majority of the platform, remains rough over much of the
floor of the Trade Winds, with only a small patch by the entrance worn by the
tread of feet.  Three quarters up the way up the wall above the entrance is 
displayed a train of feathers, gently floating in the soft wind that swirls
down through the ceiling. On the wall is a sign with the shop's hours.

The Ring of Stone
  The white walls, omnipresent throughout the platform, are hidden within this 
shop.  Reshaped by the dwarven shopkeeper, the white walls have been hidden by
cunningly cut slabs of obsidian, each no larger than a dwarf's hand.  Each 
individual piece fits into the side of the next, each unique, and fitting
perfectly.  The remainder of the shop pales in comparison; the simple,
inexpertly carved coral desk and ancient stone carving table are almost lost
in the sheer masterwork of the walls.  Only a single candelabra, resting atop
a mound of melted wax, brings light into the dark, dwarven shop, though the 
obsidian of the walls serves to amplify and reflect the light surprisingly
well.  A stone sign hangs on the wall indicating the hours the shop is open.

  This small room is lined with all of the common implements of an armorer,
save a forge.  Stacks of thin bone, sheets of thick seaweed and bins of
hardened shells lines the walls and cover the floor.  Only a large table

A wild mane of sea spray colored hair fills the head and shoulders of this
huge storm giant like an aura.  Deep, sapphire blue eyes twinkle brightly
in stark contrast to the pale blue skin of his face.  A strong, angular jaw
shapes his face with a pronounced chin giving an appearance of arrogance.
Wide shoulders support massive arms that are thick with muscle.  The torso
of this giant is more barrel-shaped, showing signs of a thickening
midsection from living a less active life.  The legs of this storm look
sturdy enough though and offer a fair amount of balance.

a row of houses to the east and a tall wall to the west. Though hidden by the
darkness, the soft sound of the water can be heard just beyond the walls.
The platform continues to the north, following the rows of lanterns, and to the
east, where it disappears into the shadows at the base of the battlement wall.
To the west is the back wall of a large white house.

Beneath the Gate
  As it runs beneath the battlements, the narrow channel through the outer wall 
is left in near complete darkness. Only a set of lanterns, a sparse row on each
side, offer any light along the dark waterway. The dim lanterns reflect faintly
off of the narrow channel as well, but fail to reveal any more of the passage 
than that. The channel continues to the west, appearing to become better lit as
it emerges from beneath the wall, and opens out onto the lake to the east.

The Star-Lit Surface of Loch Terradian
  The deeper, dark waters of the lake are as smooth as glass in the night.
The smell of lake water is so distant as not to be noticed, but a faint trace
can be found in the gentle breeze blowing through the night. The water reflects
the night sky in its smooth, black surface, seeming more polished obsidian than
water.  A pale stone wall rises from the black waters to the west with large
armored figures patrolling its ramparts by torchlight.  The wall's single gate 
is to the west, accessible only by the shallow channel marked by a pair of 
torches.

The Crashing Surf
  Large waves crest and break in here in the rapidly receding water.  The 
sound of the crashing waves is inescapable as they smash into the sandy shore, 
each struggling to reach further on the shore than the previous.  A strong
wind blows over the tops of the waves, causing a sharp, stinging mist to tear
free of the waves and sting any exposed flesh it finds.  The air is filled
with the smell of the sea and drifting mist.  The water itself is murky, dark
with disturbed sand and shells, swirling beneath the surface in a chaotic
dance.  Deeper parts of the lake lie to the west, with calmer water, while the
shore is to the east.

  Nestled within the stone walls of the academy is a small healer's alcove.
It is quite plain and rather peaceful in here.  The sounds of combat from
outside seem muffled.  In fact, everything is exceptionally quiet in here,
almost as though the stone walls absorb the sound.  The walls of this alcove
are carved and curved; each one is polished and smoothed granite.  The floor
is lined with comfortable cushions for you to rest on while you take a break
from learning.  Strangely, the stone of the ceiling is covered with an oddly 
glowing fungus.  A few benches and a cot have been placed carefully in the
alcove, and an elderly woman wearing the robes of a healer tends the needy.

By the Temple Altar
  This altar is fashioned from pale gray stone into a large crescent 
shape.  A round window high in the wall frames the moon precisely twice 
each year.  On those nights, the city is said to be under the good graces 
of neutrality, and any child born will lead a peaceful life.  The temple 
continues to the north.  Priests' chambers lie to the east and south and 
a small archway leads outside to the west.  A staircase leads downwards,

  This is the northern end of a large temple dedicated to worshipping the 
moon.  Large windows are covered with drapes during the day but uncovered 
at night so the moon can bathe the temple with its light.  The pale gray

  The wind blows up dust in this desolate section of the hard-packed road as
it runs through the grassy plains as far as the eye can see to the north

some boar taglos can be seen moving near the edge of the dark trees.  A

  Vast plains stretch to the horizon in every direction except the southwest,
where a large forest of tall, dark trees rises up from the grassy expanses.
Roads from the four cardinal directions meet here at Sumner's Crossroads,
though the traffic is not as heavy here as it would be nearer to one of
the large cities.  The wagons going to and from the various cities that
lie in all four directions cause a fairly steady flow of people, though
there are no buildings in sight in any direction to break the sea of grass.

  The old dusty road runs north-south straighter than an arrow, the monotony of
the plains dulling your senses.  The only thing that stands between a
traveler and a lost wanderer, is the simple worn down path on which you
walk.  A short wild grass covers the land all around you, growing in small
patches even on the road.  The air is fresh and comforting, away from the
cities and crowds.  Off to the south, you can see the dust rising off a road
that intersects the one you are on.

red cherries line both sides.  A small building lies just to the south with 
several people standing outside of it.  Looking further south a large
wooden building stands atop a small hill.  From its roof a brick chimney 
pipes forth smoke that seems to dance its way into the sky.  The trail 
leads south to the inn or north to the main road.  Barely visible, a smaller
path winds its way east into a small clearing.  A wooden sign, painted

trail. A colorful stream of banners line its roof. The cherry trees seem 
more barren here and small piles of spit seeds lie about the post as the 
guards pass their time endlessly munching.  A tall fence begins behind 
the post just past the trees lining the trail on both sides and follows it up 
to the inn.  Anyone trying to sneak past the guards could be easily heard 
and felt as they jumped the fence.  Music and singing filters down from

floor is dusty and scratched from seasons of use.  A few small round 
tables sit about for those customers who prefer to eat outside.  The view 
from the small hill allows one to see the tips of towers in Galadon to the 
south and Hamsah Mu'tazz to the east.  Finely carved rocking chairs creak in 
the breeze.  A large door stands in the south wall.  Music, laughter and 
stomping can be heard echoing behind it.  Covering the posts and rails of
the porch is a climbing rose, which is currently in bloom, covered with
dozens of Darkened Roses.  And a trail leads north to a main road.

Stools are scattered about for people to sit, but most stand so they can

An Orc's Den
  This room has been carved out of the mountain stone to create the living 
quarters of an important orc.  It seems that only the strongest and most
worthy of the soldiers are allowed to live in such comfort.  A raised stone
frame is covered in thick hides creating a bed of sorts. A few other personal 
items, armor and old weapons lay scattered along the floor.  A small groove
has been carved into the wall, forming a bowl-like shape which holds oil
that burns for light.  Whomever calls this place home must be mighty and
formidable in battle.  With the knowledge of how important territory is to
an orc suggests that perhaps you should not be intruding here.

An Orc's Den
  This room has been carved out of the mountain stone to create the living 
quarters of an important orc.  It seems that only the strongest and most
worthy of the soldiers are allowed to live in such comfort.  A raised stone
frame is covered in thick hides creating a bed of sorts. A few other personal 
items, armor and old weapons lay scattered along the floor.  A small groove
has been carved into the wall, forming a bowl-like shape which holds oil
that burns for light.  Whomever calls this place home must be mighty and
formidable in battle.  With the knowledge of how important territory is to
an orc suggests that perhaps you should not be intruding here.

The orc before you looks weary and disoriented, as though he has recently seen
battle.  Jagged scars upon each cheek and bare muscled arms are telltale signs 
of his grizzly trade.  Each one seems accented by his war paint or clothing, as
if to be flaunted as small badges of honor.  His red-rimmed eyes glare back at
you in sinister contempt, and seem to be sizing you up as competition.

is made of long burnt birch and the blade is extremely sharp.  Adorned on the

which makes up the blade.  It appears as if this blade was made for someone

Before the Great Tree
  You stand at the perimeter of the largest, most incredible tree that 
you have ever laid eyes on.  It has gold-flecked leaves that are the 
size of small horses, with thick roots supporting a massive trunk that
is easily twice the size of the grand fortress of the Templar Knights 
of Renhorden.  It seems to stretch endlessly into the sky, and you 
wonder why you did not see it towering above all the other trees in 
the forest.  You long to inch closer, but cannot seem to move beyond 
an invisible barrier that keeps you about a hundred yards away.  You
see movement and lights in and about the tree, but there seems to be
no way you can get closer to it.

be broken by a bit of vegetation and a ceiling of clouds. The only comfort
is a small trail that you follow with the hope that it doesn't lead to your
death. This trail weaves its way off to the west and further into the
mountains or winds itself down the side of the mountain you are on now, down
steeply to its base.

The Beginnings of a Trail
  The narrow path plunges uphill through the thick hemlock, beech and maple
forest.  The forest, once green and fertile, has turned disturbingly dark
and somewhat chilly. A cold mist hangs low near the ground, obscuring the
tangled roots that make travel somewhat difficult.  A small stone lies to
the left of the path, inscribed with some runes.

more solid ground amongst a garden of boulders. Looking down you see the
tops of some VERY tall trees and the urge to dawdle seems to leave you. You
can edge your way back down the mountain toward the forest or up the path
and into the clouds ... and obscurity. There seems to be a small break in
the rocks to the east.

  Pushing through the incredibly thick underbrush you suddenly run right into 
a shear cliff. Standing back a moment, you notice the rock's face blocking 
your way forward and dense forests blocking all the directions to all but 
the most seasoned traveler. Craning your neck, you notice a ledge, barely 
discernible from the shear face of the mountain. You see a couple of 
footholds that might let you reach up to the ledge.

A Combat Hall
  You are standing in a stone hall with its walls marked with scrapes and
scratches.  Nickes and chips of the stone has been broken away from what
appears as blunt and sharp weapons.  A statue can be seen in one corner. The
sounds of clashing metal on metal rings loudly through the room and from the
rest of the hall to the west.  A faint smell of fire drifts in from the west
as well.  You can leave the combat hall to the east.

tall. His dark orange hair is held in very long braids, falling well beyond

frame is covered in the enormous muscles typical of giants.

corner has a plate of metal is in it, heating to a red hot.  In another corner
rests a barrel of water that is used to quickly cool the items forged by the
armorer.  The heat in the room is almost unbearable, and you wonder how the

completely filled with armor of all shapes and sizes.  A sign hangs on the far

The Whispering Wind Inn
  As your eyes adjust to the darkness of the room, you first notice the large
staircase in the middle of the room that leads up to the second floor.
Although dwarves are known for their stone crafting ability, the wooden
staircase is elegantly carved.  The inn is constructed almost entirely in wood
for visitors from other lands.  Most races, such as elves, despise sleeping in
rooms of rock.  Tables are scattered around the room and a few are occupied.
The room continues to the north to the bar where drunken laughter drift from.
You can go up the staircase or leave south to Barter Road.

civilized <64%hp 79%m 96%mv 2391tnl (73.43%)> [0;37ml ornate
This axe is massive in size, appearing noble in make and design.  The haft
is made of long burnt birch and the blade is extremely sharp.  Adorned on the
shaft of the axe are colorful strips of clothing, accenting the dark onyx
which makes up the blade.  It appears as if this blade was made for someone
other than orcs, and it was probably stolen or pillaged.

An ornate, black battle-axe is an axe, made of onyx, and weighs 21 pounds 15 ounces.

The axe is about average size, but the large opal blade makes it seem a tad
heavier than most.  The sleek opal blade offers a damaging blow to those you
use it against.  The blade is attached to the wooden shaft with cords of
leather.  The handle of the shaft is wrapped in leather for a firm grip.  A
small, silver "N" has been etched into one place on the opal blade.

An axe with a blade of opal is an axe, made of opal, and weighs 24 pounds 15 ounces.

is made of long burnt birch and the blade is extremely sharp.  Adorned on the
shaft of the axe are colorful strips of clothing, accenting the dark onyx
which makes up the blade.  It appears as if this blade was made for someone
other than orcs, and it was probably stolen or pillaged.

heavier than most.  The sleek opal blade offers a damaging blow to those you

small, silver "N" has been etched into one place on the opal blade.

of a blacksmith.

As you look at this arial female you notice that she 
is covered in sleek black feathers. These feathers
glow softly in the light from the room. Her frame is 
slim and tone, and the claws on her hands and feet 
sharp and painted blood red. She has a small yellow
beak with small rounded eyes that match in color. 
Her whole face is covered in the same black feathers
that cover her body but at the top of her head she
has them arranged in a slim mohawk. She has little
jewelry on her body spare a few rings, and her

The Whispering Wind Inn
  As your eyes adjust to the darkness of the room, you first notice the large
staircase in the middle of the room that leads up to the second floor.
Although dwarves are known for their stone crafting ability, the wooden
staircase is elegantly carved.  The inn is constructed almost entirely in wood
for visitors from other lands.  Most races, such as elves, despise sleeping in
rooms of rock.  Tables are scattered around the room and a few are occupied.
The room continues to the north to the bar where drunken laughter drift from.
You can go up the staircase or leave south to Barter Road.

A Dark Corridor
  The tunnel is cut directly into the mountain, burrowing deeping into the
ground.  The smooth stone walls are covered with small carved symbols and to
the west another tunnel leads into a guard post.  There is no light in the
mountain and you hear the sounds of a blacksmith coming from deeper in the

'LASHES OF THE SLAVE' LASHESOFTHESLAVE
Syntax: lashesoftheslave

With a whip, an Anti-Paladin can strike a rapid series of blows to humiliate
and torture a victim.  The locations of the blows are guided to cause pain,
and this can leave lingering suffering, cause the victim to drop what they
are holding, demoralize them, or more.  This is not something the anti-
paladin controls directly, but rather a result of what opportunities present
themselves.

this drinking room is clean although there are several stains on the walls and
floor.  The smell of ale washes over you, making you feel slightly lightheaded.
Recipes for different types of ale decorate the walls, among the shelves of
tankards and mugs.  You can leave the drinking room to the east.

entire warren has been cut and carved directly into the rock of the mountain.
Soil covers the ground, allowing plants to grow.  Around you dwarves tend to
the rows of the white plant, Nanhok.  The walls of the warren are to the south
and west.  To the north and east the vast warrens of plant continue.

The Grog and Grub Tavern
  The room is filled with loud, drunken gossip.  Locals fill the tables in the
middle of the room.  A few, old patrons sit at the bar that rests along the
western wall.  The ale and beer is flowing almost freely and the tavern is
almost never empty.  There are even a few cots in a corner, for those unable to
stumble to their homes.  The scent of food drifts through the air making your
mouth water.  The only exit to the tavern is to the north back to Barter Road.

band once bore an intricate lock, but both are now scarred, broken and

emits is almost palpable, a black cloud of destruction and despair surround

south and Hamsah Mu'tazz to the east.  Finely carved rocking chairs creak in 
the breeze.  A large door stands in the south wall.  Music, laughter and 
stomping can be heard echoing behind it.  Covering the posts and rails of
the porch is a climbing rose, which is currently in bloom, covered with
dozens of Darkened Roses.  And a trail leads north to a main road.

Entrance to the Inn of the Eternal Star
  Music, singing, roared laughter and wild shouts rise up like a wave and 
push you back.  Smells of every kind of meat and mead grab you and 
draw you in to a flourish of people dancing and weaving about the inn. 
You wait and let your eyes adjust to the dim glow of the inn.  Large oak 
rafters hold the ceiling as it angles upwards, tall enough for a giant to 
stand in.  The crowd is varied and mixed; travelers from all over Thera 
can be seen sitting about eating and drinking.  Colorful decorations line 
the walls ranging from long tapestries to skins and skulls of rare beasts. 
To the east is a cluster of small round tables.  Directly to your south an 
area has been cleared where people are dancing and singing.  A warm 
glow filters over from a comfortable looking corner to the west.  And a 
door in the north wall leads out.

Next to the door is posted a paper listing the guidelines for behavior in the
Inn.

  Tables and chairs have been pushed away to form a large circle.  The floor 
is worn and smooth from heavy boots scraping and dancing.  A large wooden 
chandelier hangs overhead lined with thick red candles.  Patrons and barmaids 
swirl about as they enter the circle while others clap and sing watching from 
outside.  A warm orange fiery glow comes from the west.  To the south can be 
seen the main bar and many swinging mugs raised to toast.  Music and laughter 
come from the east from a stage raised up against the wall.  To the north is
the entrance of the inn.

The Tale-Telling Fire
  A huge gray stone fireplace lies in the west wall.  Small statues sit atop a 
thick oaken mantle; their shadows dance against the wall in the fire's 
light.  The fire seems to move with a beat of its own, slow and rhythmic, 
moving back and forth.  Despite its large size the fire barely whispers a 
crackle and its heat only surrounds you in a warm glow.  Plush couches and 
chairs surround the fire and a large rug covers the floor.  As if respecting 
the tales to be told, the noise from the rest of the inn also seems to quiet 
and dim to a dull mutter.  A painting hangs above the mantle, swirling 
with colors.  People sing and dance to the east in a cleared area.  To the 
north more soft chairs and tables sit about while to the south lie long
tables stacked with food.

A Cozy Corner
  The warm glow of the fire surrounds the soft chairs and tables in this 
corner.  Small bookshelves sit against the walls.  The strong smell of pipe 
smoke fills the air as smoke rings dance about.  Cloaks and blankets hang 
on pegs in the western wall, slowly being dried by the fire's breath.  Wine 
glasses and cups of coffee and tea rest on the tables here, attracting a 
different lot than the rest of the inn.  The entrance to the inn lies east 
while a circle of chairs sits around a fire to the south.

You see a collection of stories along one shelf of the bookcases.

  The glow of the fire and torches does not reach this alcove.  Tucked away 
with the windows shuttered only a single table sits here.  The rest of the

never lingering long.  Faces are covered in shadow and hard to make out.

The Rabbit's Corner
  A restless feeling swims through here.  Eyes shift about as gold and gems 
jingle and change hands.  Food and ale are passed around freely by the 
victors and readily taken by those wanting to win something.  Every 
known kind of game is played here, gold and gems being the prize most 
seek to win.  One table roars with victory and others echo with weeping 
and cries of torment.  Inn guards watch closely, making sure nobody gets 
too far out of hand.  Colorful cards fly across tables, and wheels whirl and 
spin.  Barmaids cling to and keep close care of those who seem to be doing 
well.  A stage lies north and the main bar sits to the west while a small rowdy
room to the south shakes with noise.  In the eastern wall stands a finely 
carved door with a boar's head etched on it.

it has been finely carved and oiled so that it shines in the dim light.  Food

swing through the air for a toast.  Shelves behind the bar hold the rare 
ales and beers while large barrels sit stacked with the poorer drinks. 
Stools are scattered about for people to sit, but most stand so they can 
stomp and dance when the moment takes them.  A large tapestry hangs 
over the shelves behind the bar.  People swarm in and crowd, pressing to 
be nearer, calling out drinks and stumbling to hold on to their own.  To 
the north the crowd swirls, dancing and singing in a common area.  Eastwards,
